Email Classification

Email classification is the process of categorizing emails into predefined categories such as "Spam" or "Not Spam," "Business" or "Personal," etc. This classification task is crucial in managing large volumes of emails, especially for filtering spam and organizing messages.

Project Description:
In this project, the goal is to build an email classification system using machine learning techniques. The system will analyze the content of emails and classify them into different categories based on their text features. This involves various steps, including data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

Key Steps:
Data Collection:

Emails data can be sourced from public datasets like the "SpamAssassin" or "Enron" datasets, which contain labeled emails as spam or ham (non-spam).
Data Preprocessing:

Convert the raw email text into a structured format suitable for analysis.
Perform text preprocessing steps like removing stop words, stemming, and lemmatization to clean the text data.
Handle missing values and remove duplicates to ensure data quality.
Feature Extraction:

Transform the textual data into numerical features using techniques such as CountVectorizer or TfidfVectorizer.
These features represent the frequency or importance of words in the emails, which are then used to train the model.
Model Selection:

Choose a classification algorithm (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression) suitable for text classification tasks.
Train the model on the preprocessed and vectorized email data.
Model Training and Evaluation:

Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train the model on the training data and evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualize the results using a confusion matrix and other relevant plots.
Model Optimization:

Perform hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.
Experiment with different algorithms and preprocessing techniques to achieve better classification accuracy.
Deployment:

Once satisfied with the model's performance, save it for deployment.
The model can be integrated into an email filtering system to automatically categorize incoming emails.
Outcome:
By the end of this project, a functional email classification model will be developed that can accurately classify emails into categories. The system can be further enhanced to handle more complex categorization tasks or integrated into larger email management systems. The project demonstrates practical applications of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning in real-world scenarios.
